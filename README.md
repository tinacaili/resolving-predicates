This lab is intended to continue to broaden your experience with programming language features and design approaches in C++, and with expression parsing, representation, matching, and transformation techniques (again using Horn clauses from logic programming as a specific example), including:

    Parsing and storing representations of Horn clauses;
    Unifying predicates but this time doing so based on functions and bound and unbound variables as well as constants;
    Performing resolution of the two Horn clauses to produce another Horn clause that is added to the deductive database; and
    Interacting with the user of the program to obtain and handle additional commands.
